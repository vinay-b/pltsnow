1. first you need byacc for java

2. next once your get the binaries you need to add them somewhere on your path so that the make finds it.

3. now you can go to SVNPATH/src/ and run the makefile
	make mac
    make all (for linux) 

4. finally to run parser you run the following from the src directory in the svn
	make sample1
	make sample2
	and so on or you can use the following

    java com/google/code/pltsnow/gen/Parser ../sample/sample#.snow 

    ex: java com/google/code/pltsnow/gen/Parser ../sample/sample3.snow 

    and you can send it to SnowProgramImp?.java with ">" to refresh the SnowProgramImp?.java in the editor if you have it open. 

5. then you can run 
	make test
	which compiles the SnowProgramImp.java which may or may not work depending on
	how far our compiler is.
	
6.	finally if it compiled run
	make run
