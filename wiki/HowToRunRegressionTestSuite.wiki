Regression Suite Execution

Goto directory test under trunk
Execute runSuite.sh

It will make, compile and run diff and report errors.

For this to work, do run this every time you change code. As and when required update the expected generated code under test/sample-compiled/sampleX/ for the corresponding sampleX.snow program.
