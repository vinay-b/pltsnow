  _each generation

  _each mutation

  each mating

  each selection

  organism born

  organism killed

  organism mutated

  organism mates with organism

  organism fitness changes

== Debugging Modifiers == 
  before

  after


== Environmental Parameters ==
  population size

  mutation rate


== Environmental Variables/Descriptors ==

  _average age_


== Functions/Operators ==

=== List operators ===
{{{
first()
last()
max()
min() 
sum()
average() 
append()
extend()
pop() 
push() 
index() 
for..in..
reverse() 
filter() 
search() 
sort()
}}}

=== Chromosome Operators ===
`splice [at \d[%] [and \d]]`  on two implicit chromosomes

= Snippets =

{{{
to construct organism:
    (global organism.count)
    name = count;  // dynamic construction
    fingers = 10;  // random construction
    for gene in chromosome:
        gene.x = gene.count;
        gene.y = random; // automatic typing


to mate male and female:
    splice [at 5[%] [and 10]]

to mutate organism:
    // mate with implicit random organism

each generation:
        population_size = population_size *= 1.01
        // etc.
        // these variable are evaluated each generation

// debugging statements
before organism killed:
    print "killing organism"

after mutations:
    print "done with mutations"
