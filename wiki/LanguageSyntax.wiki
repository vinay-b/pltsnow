to construct organism:
    (global organism.count)
    name = count;  // dynamic construction
    fingers = 10;  // random construction
    for gene in chromosome:
        gene.x = gene.count;
        gene.y = random; // automatic typing


to mate male and female:
    splice [at 5[%] [and 10]]

to mutate organism:
    // mate with implicit random organism

each generation:
        population_size = population_size *= 1.01
        // etc.
        // these variable are evaluated each generation

// debugging statements
before organism killed:
    print "killing organism"

after mutations:
    print "done with mutations"
