1. first you need byacc for java
     <a href="http://byaccj.sourceforge.net/#download">Link here</a>

2. next once your get the binaries you need to add them somewhere on your path so that the make finds it.

3. now you can go to SVNPATH/src/ and run the makefile
    make mac<br>
    make all (for linux) 

4. finally to run parser you run the following from the src directory in the svn
	make sample1<br>
	make sample2<br><br>
	and so on or you can use the following<br>

    java com/google/code/pltsnow/gen/Parser ../sample/sample#.snow 

    ex: java com/google/code/pltsnow/gen/Parser ../sample/sample3.snow 

    and you can send it to SnowProgramImp?.java with ">" to refresh the SnowProgramImp?.java in the editor if you have it open. 

5. then you can run <br>
	make test<br>
	which compiles the SnowProgramImp.java which may or may not work depending on
	how far our compiler is.
	
6.	finally if it compiled run<br>
	make run
