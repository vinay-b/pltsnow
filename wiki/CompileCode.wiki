1. first you need byacc for java
     <a href="http://byaccj.sourceforge.net/#download">Link here</a>

2. next once your get the binaries you need to add them somewhere on your
path so that the make finds it.

3. now you can go to SVNPATH/src/
and run the makefile

4. finally to run parser you run the following from the src directory in the svn
     java com/google/code/pltsnow/gen/Parser ../sample/sample#.snow

     ex:  java com/google/code/pltsnow/gen/Parser ../sample/sample3.snow

     and you can send it to SnowProgramImp.java with ">" to refresh the SnowProgramImp.java in the editor if you have it open.


Note: i will edit makefile to make this command shorter.
